Please follow the instructions below in order to obtain the wanted results:
1.	Ideally you are supposed to use the prototype (ELISA prototype.csv) given. Otherwise, convert your files (.xlsx, .ods, etc) to .csv format.
2.	When asked to define positive and negative control cells, please use integers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ) instead of letters to describe rows and capitals (X1, X2, X3, X4 ….) for columns.  
3.	30% and 40% reactivity are described by r30 and r40 respectively.
4.	Final table indicates positive samples with “+”, negative with “-“  and leaves the respective Optical Density values for samples that fall in the r30<sample<r40 range.

Enjoy your immunosorbent assays,
